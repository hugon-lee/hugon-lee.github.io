In the realm of technologically important short fiber and particulate-reinforced composites, homogenization approaches based on micromechanics are extensively explored for estimating inherent effective properties. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the core principles underpinning micromechanics-based homogenization, as well as its advancements and applications encompassing: (i) predicting nonlinear reactions under complex and cyclic loading conditions, (ii) accounting for interfacial imperfections, and (iii) estimating various effective physical properties. We also delve into the integration of (iv) data-driven strategies, aiming to augment the accuracy of predictions. We conclude the article by discussing a seminal challenge, (v) the prediction of localized failure.
